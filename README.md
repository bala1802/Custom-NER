# Named Entity Recognition on Medical Data

## Purpose:

The purpose of this repository is to Train a Named Entity Recognition model from the scratch.

## Dataset:
### About:
This dataset was created to train a Spacy model to perform Named Entity Recognition for three categories:
- Medical condition names (example: influenza, headache, malaria)
- Medicine names (example : aspirin, penicillin, ribavirin, methotrexate)
- Pathogens ( example: Corona Virus, Zika Virus, cynobacteria, E. Coli)

### Source:
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/finalepoch/medical-ner/data

## Configuration:

- The Configuration file can be generated by executing this command `! python -m spacy init config config.cfg --lang en --pipeline ner --optimize efficiency`
- Can also be generated by getting the configuration from https://spacy.io/usage/training#quickstart
