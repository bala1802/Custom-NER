# Named Entity Recognition on Medical Data

## Purpose:

The purpose of this repository is to Train a Named Entity Recognition model from the scratch.

## Dataset:
### About:
This dataset was created to train a Spacy model to perform Named Entity Recognition for three categories:
- Medical condition names (example: influenza, headache, malaria)
- Medicine names (example : aspirin, penicillin, ribavirin, methotrexate)
- Pathogens ( example: Corona Virus, Zika Virus, cynobacteria, E. Coli)

### Source:
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/finalepoch/medical-ner/data

## Configuration:

- The Configuration file can be generated by executing this command `! python -m spacy init config config.cfg --lang en --pipeline ner --optimize efficiency`
- Can also be generated by getting the configuration from https://spacy.io/usage/training#quickstart

## Model Training:

- The model training is done on the `training_data.psacy` and validated on the `validation_data.spacy`.
- The command to train the spacy model is `! python -m spacy train config.cfg --output ./ --paths.train ./training_data.spacy --paths.dev ./validation_data.spacy`

## Model Testing:

The Medical test data is identified to test the trained model

### Test Data:

'''
The patient was prescribed Aspirin for their heart condition.
The doctor recommended Ibuprofen to alleviate the patient's headache.
The patient is suffering from diabetes, and they need to take Metformin regularly.
After the surgery, the patient experienced some post-operative complications, including infection.
The patient is currently on a regimen of Lisinopril to manage their high blood pressure.
The antibiotic course for treating the bacterial infection should be completed as prescribed.
The patient's insulin dosage needs to be adjusted to better control their blood sugar levels.
The physician suspects that the patient may have pneumonia and has ordered a chest X-ray.
The patient's cholesterol levels are high, and they have been advised to take Atorvastatin.
The allergy to penicillin was noted in the patient's medical history.

## Why do we need Custom NER (Named Entity Recognition) model trained from the scratch, when we have BERT based models, RoBERTa etc?

1. `Domain-specific entities`: Pre-trained NER models like BERT are trained on a wide range of text from the internet and may not perform optimally for `domain-specific entities`. If the application or research we work involves `specialized jargon, industry-specific terms, or rare entities`, a `Custom NER` model can be fine-tuned on the domain-specific data to `improve accuracy`.

2. `Data annotation quality`: Custom NER allows us to have full control over the `annotation` process, ensuring that the training data can accurately reflect the entities of interest in the `specific context`, reducing the chances of `false positives or negatives` that might occur with `generic pre-trained` models.

3. `Adaptation to unique requirements`: Every application has its own unique requirements and constraints. Custom NER models can be tailored to meet these specific needs.

4. `Privacy and data sensitivity`: In some cases, we may be working with sensitive data that cannot be shared with external pre-trained models. `Custom NER` allows us to develop an `in-house` solution that respects privacy and data security concerns.
